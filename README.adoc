== Requirements

- bash
- s3cmd (apt-get install s3cmd)
- inotify-tools (apt-get install inotify-tools)

Tested in link:Dockerfile[Dockerfile]


== Configuration

[source, bash]
----

s3cmd --configure --config=<your s3 bucket>.cfg
----
provide it credentials. A file will be created, which can be used by s3cmd later on.

== TEST

I tested it out in a (custom) ubuntu image

[source, bash]
----
make docker
make test S3=<your s3 bucket>
----
This will watch your /tmp/<bucket name> and sync it to s3://<bucket name>

== TODO

The script can be crontabbed, but something must be arranged to keep it alive. May be it can just be put to inittab.

It supports only one directory/s3 now. May be we can just have an instance per directory.

Routing to different s3-targets could just be done by splitting the S3 string.
